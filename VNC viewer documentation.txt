If your Raspberry Pi is headless (that is, not plugged into a monitor) or embedded in a robot, it’s unlikely to be running a graphical desktop.

VNC Server can run in Virtual Mode to create a resource-efficient virtual desktop on demand, giving you graphical remote access even when there is no actual desktop to remote. This virtual desktop exists only in your Raspberry Pi’s memory:

../_images/raspberry-pi-virtual.png
To do this:

On your Raspberry Pi, run the command vncserver. Make a note of the IP address/display number printed to the console, for example 192.167.5.149:1.
On the device you will use to take control, enter this information in VNC Viewer.
Stopping a virtual desktop
A virtual desktop persists until you explicitly destroy it. Run the following command when you are sure it is no longer needed:

vncserver -kill :<display-number>

Note this command will terminate any current connections without warning to those users.
